           <p>Welcome to my Website!<br> My name is Sandra and my favorite hobby is taking pictures. <br> I would define my style as colorful, and my favorite things to photograph are my dog and close friends. <br> Two photographers that I admire are Jill Greenberg and Brandon Woefel. Their styles are both unique and colorful which catch my eye.<br>  Follow My Dog on Instagram! <br> (Click the Picture!)<br> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the.frankie.sausage/?hl=en">
